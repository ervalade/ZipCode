To set up Eclipse to run JavaScript files:

In Eclipse, got to Run > External Tools > External Tool Configurations

Double click on Program to open a new configuration and name your new configuration (ex. Node_Config)

Figure out where you have node.js installed. Paste the results in the 'Location' box in Eclipse.
 (If you haven't installed node, do so here)

Mac: in the command line, run which node.
Windows: in the command line, run where node, or see this for more/different windows advice
Fill in the following:

Working Directory: ${container_loc}
Arguments: ${resource_name}
Click apply, and then close.

Now, in the main Eclipse screen, find the play button with a red toolbox (next to the regular play button). 
When you have a js file open that you want to run, click this and it will be just like running it from 
your console using node.
